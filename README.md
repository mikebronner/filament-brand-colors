# Brand Colored Filaments

Hi all, 

I have been in search of filaments to match specific brands as closely as possible, and I thought it might be helpful to aggregate that in one place, as there seem to be several other threads looking for specific brand colors, but no one thread to rule them all.

I will attempt to keep this top post updated with any contributions in replies. Please only post filaments that you have printed and verified. If you can provide an image with the printout next to a brand item, that would help everyone gauge the fit who is looking for that color. If a better match is found down the road, the list will always be updated with the best match.

The following resources may help in finding filaments by color.
